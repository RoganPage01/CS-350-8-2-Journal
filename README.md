Project Summary

This project involved developing a prototype for a smart thermostat using a TI development board, aimed at entering the rapidly growing smart thermostat market. The prototype was designed to read room temperature using the TMP006 sensor, control heating status via an LED indicator, adjust set temperatures with buttons, and simulate server communication through UART. This foundational work is a step towards creating a smart thermostat that can send data to SysTecâ€™s server software over Wi-Fi.

Accomplishments

I excelled in integrating various hardware components and ensuring seamless communication between them. The TMP006 sensor was effectively interfaced to provide accurate temperature readings, and the GPIO controls for the LED and buttons were implemented smoothly. Additionally, the UART communication was established successfully to simulate data transmission, showcasing my ability to manage low-level embedded systems programming.

Areas for Improvement

There are several areas where I can improve. First, enhancing my time management skills will allow for more thorough testing and debugging, ensuring a more robust final product. Additionally, optimizing the code for efficiency and reducing power consumption is an area I plan to focus on in future projects. Improving error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected scenarios more gracefully is another area for growth.

Support Network

Throughout this project, I have added several tools and resources to my support network. The TI development board, alongside I2C, GPIO, and UART libraries, has been instrumental. I have also utilized embedded C/C++ for programming, which has strengthened my coding skills. These resources, combined with community forums and documentation, will be invaluable for future projects.

Transferable Skills

This project has helped me develop several skills that are highly transferable to other projects and coursework. I have honed my embedded systems programming skills, particularly in integrating sensors and peripherals. My problem-solving abilities have been enhanced through debugging and troubleshooting hardware-software interactions. Additionally, this project has improved my project management skills, balancing multiple tasks and adhering to deadlines.

Project Maintenance

To ensure the project remains maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I implemented several best practices. Comprehensive documentation and detailed comments were added to the code, making it easier for others to understand and modify. The code was structured into modules, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance. Adhering to industry-standard coding practices ensured the code was clean and efficient, facilitating future expansions and modifications.
